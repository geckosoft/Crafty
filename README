Crafty is a java => c# conversion of the original minecraft server.Since this project is based on decompiled minecraft server code, I give the full rights to Mojang, so they may use this code as they see fit.Currently requires Visual Studio 2010 to compile.Make sure to report back bugs!Changelog:----------# 13/03/2011 - Beta 1.3.1.1 - Initial release- Converted all java to c# - Uses IKVM to cover for the missing java core classes- Included the MCP conf/patch files used to deobfuscate the files- Included a partial SupportClass, that was generated by the VS2005 java conversion wizard- Included font.txt, put this file in the same folder as the CraftyServer.exe file
